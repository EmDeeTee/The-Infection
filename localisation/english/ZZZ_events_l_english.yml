 zzz_outbreak.2.t:0 "The Symptoms"
 zzz_outbreak.2.desc:0 "Now, that time has passed, more information about the 'Black Atlanta' is available.\n\nPatients are reporting symptoms such as fatigue, mild skin irritation, headaches, and a subtle loss of hearing and sight. Additionally, some individuals are experiencing elevated temperatures.

 zzz_outbreak.3.t:0 "The Quarantine"
 zzz_outbreak.3.desc:0 "Turns out, more people in India are infected than initially thought. The WHO and the Indian government have issued a quarantine in the affected region.\n\nMoreover, there are some unofficial reports sayng, that 'Black Atlanta' has the ability to reanimate the dead. What a joke!... right?\n\n§RZombie awarness§! mechanic becomes available. It represents how aware your population is of the looming zombie threat.

 zzz_outbreak.5.desc:0 "Dead are rising! The news spread over the Internet like a wildfire. hundreds of videos flood online platforms depicting corpses that defy the natural order - things that shouldn't move, yet they are moving, flinching. Exposed bone and muscle. Rotten skin falling off.\n\nThe §RZOMBIE HORDE§! has risen. now, the rotten people are slow and weak... But §RTHEY ARE BILLIONS§! and will §OEVOLVE§! over time.

 zzz_outbreak.6.t:0 "ZCOM"
 zzz_outbreak.6.desc:0 "Today We have received word, that an international military organisation called "ZCOM" has been established in Iceland. Governments around the world join efforts to combat the zombie threat. Such an operation on a global scale will cost a massive amount of money. So much so, that even the wealthiest country cannot fund it on their own.\n\nBecome §Gsupportive§! of the newfound organisation and join with intentions of sending aid and potentially give all countries a better fighting chance\n\nOR\n\nBecome §Risolationist§! and try to defend against the threat alone"
 zzz_outbreak.6.a:0 "We will join the effort"

 ZZZ_awareness_bump_1:0 "Silent awareness campaign"
 ZZZ_awareness_bump_1_desc:0 "We can silently put zombies on minds of our citizens by silently promoting the idea. Put books about zombies in libraries, pay game developers to make games about zombies and give them away for free, film "documentaries" about a very "theoretical" scenario of a zombie apocalypse.\n\nBy doing this, We can make our people more paranoid. Not very effective, but cheap and safe."
